We started off the week a little bit unsure of the structure of our application and an unfamiliarity with some of the technologies we would be using. 

On Monday, I met with my team to discuss what stack we would be using, and code style guidelines. We also discussed our vision for how the app should function. After our meeting, I proceeded to research the things none of us were familiar with,namely Docusign and Chainpoint. I started with Chainpoint and after spending some timw with thair documentation, I felt that the best thing for us to use was their Chainpoint Javascript Client. This installs as an NPM package and seemed really straightforward and easy to use.

Next, I tackled the DocuSign documentation.
